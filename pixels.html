				<h1>Nature's Palette</h1>
					
				<p>
					I had always been curious about Photoshop. I am glad I got to try it out in a class. It took
					some time to understand the core difference between Photoshop and Illustrator. But it completely
					makes sense now how one is pixel based and the other is vector based.
					<br><br>
					During the week when this assignment was due, I was on a hiking trip with a friend. One of
					the pictures we took was that of the color pencils. Looking at the picture, the title "Nature's
					Palette" came to my mind. From there, I selected the other pictures that could fit into the
					concept. So the final image came about with 4 different pictures from the trip.
					<br><br>
					After placing the images in layers, I did a pass with paint brushes to make them look more
					blended in, where they overlapped. One area was the horizon line. Since the sky had sunset
					shades and the water had an afternoon sun reflection. I added a black paint with transparency
					on the pencil colors image as they had a light source coming from the top vs from the
					front. It's not perfect but it blends a little better.
					<br><br>
					The shoes and the colors where tricky for tracing the outlines. I used magic lasso tool and
					then added and subtracted specific points by zooming in a lot. Overall, I am happy with
					how it turned out. It's like a summary of my trip, where I hiked, sketched, enjoyed sunset and
					ocean views. Being in the nature was very relaxing!
