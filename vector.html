				<h1>An artist's block</h1>
					
				<p>
					I picked up Illustrator in a Graphics Design class. My first experience was jumping right
					in without any tutorials, experimenting with the tools and generating a final result for the
					projects then. I'd say I learned the software the hard way by taking a difficult approach of
					scanning an artwork and adjusting vector points. Features like tracing a shape are the best
					part of illustrator for me and it took me a while to discover those.
					<br><br>
					For this project, it was difficult to come with an idea. I kept brainstorming and never really
					reached a strong visual. So I started looking at various sites for inspiration. While browsing
					through Unsplash website, I came across the image with the two jars in background. I liked
					it and wanted to use it in some way. From there, the rest of the idea came together. The
					character I drew came naturally as it's is a comic book character I've drawn for years.
					<br><br>
					In making this project I explored various Illustrator tools. The text labels in black was a bit of
					experimentation with rounded corners. I used a similar approach with the fluid in Motivation
					jar. I sketched the pose of character on paper first but when I started using the pen tool in
					Illustrator, the lines didn't come out to be smooth. So I redid it a bunch of times.
					<br><br>
					Overall, I am happy how I turned my "no ideas" phase into an idea! I really like working in
					Illustrator.
