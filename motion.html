				<h1>Storytelling with animation</h1>
					
				<p>
					This was my first time using Animate. At first glance, the software seemed very confusing.
					The interface is so different from Photoshop and Illustrator. After getting the hang of basic
					tools, I understood how this software makes it easy to fill the "in-between" frames of an
					animation.
					<br><br>
					For this project, I struggled a lot with nailing down exactly what I was going to make. I
					made some rough sketches but got into the software too soon. At first I laid out a 2 second
					animation but later decided to extend to 3 seconds. The lack of planning took a toll as I
					worked on the project. I had to rethink the postures and redo the drawings as a result of
					this.
					<br><br>
					There is still room for improvements. Though in general, I am happy with the end result.
					Seeing my character come to life felt really rewarding. The process of making an animation
					is time consuming and iterative. Now, I can appreciate all the work that animators put in to
					make their final peice.
