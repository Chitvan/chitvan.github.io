				<h1>Making books</h1>
					
				<p>
					I've always been curious about Indesign. When I was in high school, I helped someone type their 
					book for some pocket money. It was a maths book typed in a software I can't remember now, but 
					working on it was not fun. So discovering the powers of Indesign was relieving!  
					<br><br>
					I've thought about what to do with my art and books have always intrigued me. Specially 
					children's books with art and story. For this project, I started with exploring layout ideas. I'd
					say typing the content was what took me the most time. And I've re-used it on this website, if 
					you can't tell! Perhaps I can explore making vines in Indesign in future. 
					<br><br>
					In making this website, I realized how I've just been using the same color combinations 
					everywhere with shades of Blue and Teal. In my next project I'll probably try some thing new. No 
					promises though!
