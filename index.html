				<h1>Hi, I'm Chitvan!</h1>
					
				<p>
					I grew up in India. I remember drawing as a kid to get my emotions 
					out on a page. But over	the
					years, as I picked Science as my area of focus in High School, I stopped making art. The hectic
					student life and the pressure to perform well in school to get into a college, took over my life.
					<br><br>
					Few years later when I started working as an Engineer, I discovered white boards in office. To me, 
					they looked like a canvas ready to be drawn on. That rekindled the spark in me. Though it was also 
					around the time that I decided to move to the US to pursue a Masters degree in Computer Science and 
					Gaming.
					<br><br>
					In the years that followeed, art became an on-off hobby. It was hard to make time for it. Plus the 
					gap in what I made vs what I wanted to make was disappointing. So it became a mental block. Somehow 
					then, I made artist friends at work and being with them helped me. They encouraged me to explore my 
					interest and helped me in picking mediums.
					<br><br>
					I got over the fear of my unknown destination with art and started taking classes at CCSF in 2019. 
					From the very first I stepped foot in that class to now- all I can say is that I am very happy to be
					here, to be able to learn, to draw, make art, express myself and get the visual out of head into 
					something you can view. Presenting some of my works in this portfolio.
